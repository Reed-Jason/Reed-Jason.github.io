        <p class="p1">Now, this version of pong is a little different from the orginal. The original game is 
        similar to tennis where you have two paddles, and you have to defeat your oponent by reaching to 
        the score of 10 first. "Nolan Bushnell founded Atari at 1972 in order to create games and ideas and 
        license them to other companies for mass production. Pong was actually a training exercise for one 
        of Atari's employees - Allan Alcorn, Once it was finished, Nolan made few adjustments in order to
        make the game more interesting (like changing the ball's return angle) and added simple sound effects"
